# PyTorch_Tutorials
Tutorials in using PyTorch for Deep Learning.

# Current Tutorials
1. `Tutorial 1: Basics` includes documentation on setting up Conda, Pytorch, and Jupyter on Mac, Windows, and Linux. There is then a tutorial on setting up a basic Neural Net in PyTorch.

# Future Tutorials
2. `Tutorial 2: Regularization` will have a lesson on popular regularization methods for neural networks, namely l1 & l2 penalities, dropout, and early stopping.
3. `Tutorial 3: GPU Support` will include documentation for those with NVIDIA gpus on setting up drivers for their GPUS and installing CUDA, and cuDNN, libraries neccessary for GPU support. There will then be a tutorial on integration GPU support into PyTorch, which can greatly speed up training.

4. `Tutorial 4: CNN and RNN` will be about setting up convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and recurrent neural nets (RNNs) in PyTorch which are good for image and text processing respectively. In the case of RNNs, LSTMs and attention will be touched upon.
